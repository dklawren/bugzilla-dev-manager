this is how i manage my bugzilla development environments.  i'll have to do a
real readme at some stage.

it's here just so i can version control it; i don't really expect it to work
anywhere outside my vm :)

INSTALL

1. edit BugzillaDevConfig.pm
2. edit the lib path in bz and www/index.cgi
3. add an shell alias to bz, or drop a symlink in your path
4. create a working directory (can be based anywhere):
     /opt/bugzilla/htdocs
     /opt/bugzilla/repo
5. change apache to set it to run as your shell user, point
   the default directory to your htdocs
6. create a symlink from every file in www/ in htdocs:
     bkg_warning.png -> /opt/bugzilla/repo/git/bugzilla-dev-manager/www/bkg_warning.png
     bug.gif -> /opt/bugzilla/repo/git/bugzilla-dev-manager/www/bug.gif
     favicon.ico -> /opt/bugzilla/repo/git/bugzilla-dev-manager/www/favicon.ico
     index.cgi -> /opt/bugzilla/repo/git/bugzilla-dev-manager/www/index.cgi
     mail_warning.png -> /opt/bugzilla/repo/git/bugzilla-dev-manager/www/mail_warning.png

and other stuff i've probably missed :)
